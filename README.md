<h1>Appointment Management System</h1>
<p>An appointment management system developed using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) as well as TypeScript, and Bootstrap. This project is a demonstration of a system where different users (Admin, Doctors, and Patients) can manage and keep track of appointments.</p>

<h2>About the test</h2>
<p>In approaching this project, I began by creating the fundamental API structures and developing a basic workflow. This provided me with a clear roadmap to follow. One aspect I enjoyed was the flexibility to use my preferred tech stack, which allowed me to work within a familiar environment. However, the tight timeline posed a significant challenge, especially when balancing it with my regular weekday commitments. The main issue I faced was in making key design(ui) decisions within the limited timeframe.

<h2>Estimated time to complete yourtest.</h2>
<p>I estimate that I will be able to complete the test by Sunday evening.(30 July 2023) </p>
<h2>Pending Tasks</h2>
<p>The major pending tasks include adding the Captcha authentication system and implementing specific logic in the appointment booking process. Once these core functionalities are in place, I will finalize the overall workflow and refactor the code for optimization and better readability. </p>
